\## üèóÔ∏è First a note about Code Drift in LLM Systems.

---\### \*\*RESEARCH FOUNDATION:\*\*

\- \*\*Conversational Drift Prevention\*\* - Phaneendra Kumar Namala research

\- \*\*Agent Communication Protocols\*\* - Google A2A, Anthropic MCP standards  

\- \*\*Accessibility Compliance\*\* - ADA/WCAG human-AI collaboration requirements

\- \*\*Session Management\*\* - Best practices for AI behavior consistency

\- \*\*To: Claude - Please take a moment to review this research online and familiarize your self regarding these matters.  


\## üèóÔ∏è THREE-STAGE ARCHITECTURE



\*\*STAGE 1: BATCH-EXTRACTOR (Current Focus)\*\*

\- Purpose: Extract video content from Adam's platforms

\- Tools: Enhanced integration

\- Input: Adam's training platforms (DIYTRAX, METRICMOVER, etc.)

\- Output: MP3/MP4 files in organized TCE-MEDIA folders

\- Status: Enhanced extractor is still experimental, not proven but  good workflow established with proven Video Capture Software (VDH) and some good code to handle batch processing, error checking and recovery.



\*\*STAGE 2: TRANSCRIPTION ENGINE (Proven \& Ready)\*\*

\- Purpose: Convert audio/video ‚Üí Professional text with timestamps

\- Tools: Battle-tested OpenAI Whisper API integration (175+ hours development)

\- Input: MP3/MP4 files from Stage 1

\- Output: TXT files with timestamps, metadata, quality control

\- Status: COMPLETE - 138.24 WPM baseline, auto-retry, professional quality



\*\*STAGE 3: INDEX APPLICATION (Future Development)\*\*

\- Purpose: Transform TXT files ‚Üí Searchable business manual

\- Components: Content analysis, procedure extraction, search interface

\- Input: TXT files from Stage 2

\- Output: Google Drive shareable HTML with JavaScript search

\- Status: Architecture planned, ready for development

\## ‚öôÔ∏è CRITICAL API SETTINGS



\*\*OpenAI Whisper API Configuration:\*\*

```python

response\_format="verbose\_json"  # REQUIRED for INDEX timestamps

model="whisper-1"

temperature=0.0

language=None  # Auto-detect

```



\*\*Quality Control Baseline:\*\*

```python

BASELINE\_WPM = 138.24        # Gold standard (statistically validated)

CRITICAL\_THRESHOLD = 110     # Auto-retry below this

WARNING\_THRESHOLD = 120      # Flag for review

CONFIDENCE\_LEVEL = 99        # Validated on 16-file sample

```



\*\*Chunking System:\*\*

```python

CHUNK\_SIZE = 5 \* 1024 \* 1024  # 5MB (well under 25MB limit)

OVERLAP\_SECONDS = 30          # Context preservation

METHOD = "FFmpeg"             # Proven approach

```
\## üìÅ PROJECT STRUCTURE \& SAFETY RULES


\*\*ENGINE-PROJECT Location:\*\* `C:\\ENGINE-PROJECT\\`

\*\*INDEX-PROJECT Location:\*\* `C:\\INDEX-PROJECT\\`

\*\*FOLDER SAFETY RULES:\*\*

```


‚úÖ SAFE TO WORK IN:

‚úÖ TCE-INDEX/The Use of Experimental Folders/ ‚Üê Test new features here FIRST.  

Move the user to these experimental folders when working on an app that normally resides in that folder.  

The PowerShell needs to be navigated to that directory to begin a run that will update that file. File updates are always saved in the directory Claude navigates us to. This crucial functionality must be preserved throughout the Session.

‚úÖ docs/session\_guides/      ‚Üê Update session documentation

ADD --ARCHIVE all previous work on the INDEX code.  User will clean up and organize after each session to confirm all files are in their right places. User will up-date these documents and manage development.
```


\*\*MANDATORY WORKFLOW:\*\*

1\. BEFORE ANY ENGINE CHANGES: Create backup in `backups/manual/`

2\. COPY TO EXPERIMENTAL: Work in /experimental/` ONLY

3\. TEST THOROUGHLY: Verify all features work

4\. GET USER APPROVAL: Before touching `working/` folder

5\. MOVE TO WORKING: Only after complete testing

\## üè¢ BUSINESS CONTEXT



\*\*Company:\*\* The Cherrington Media (27 employees, 1,000's of Students)

\*\*Owner:\*\* Adam Cherrington

\*\*Business:\*\* Affiliate Arbitrage training system

\*\*Challenge:\*\* 900,000+ words of TXT files ‚Üí searchable student interface



\*\*Student Need:\*\*

\- BEFORE INDEX: Students watch hours of video to find one procedure

\- AFTER INDEX: Students find exact procedures in seconds with quality rankings



\*\*Success Metrics:\*\*

\- Time Reduction: Hours of video watching ‚Üí Seconds of search

\- Quality Ranking: "Top 3 most coherent" procedures for every search

\- Accessibility: Works on all devices, printable references available

\- Scalability: Handles growing content library with weekly updates

\## üìä QUALITY STANDARDS


\*\*Statistical Validation System:\*\*

\- Baseline: 138.24 words/minute (statistically validated)

\- Warning: 120 WPM (flag for review)

\- Critical: 110 WPM (auto-retry)

\- Confidence: 99% validated on 16-file sample



\*\*Quality Indicators:\*\*

\- üü¢ Excellent: ‚â•130 words/minute

\- üü° Good: 120-129 words/minute

\- üü† Warning: 110-119 words/minute

\- üî¥ Critical: <110 words/minute (auto-retry)



\*\*Auto-Retry Logic:\*\*

```

IF words\_per\_minute < 110 THEN

&nbsp;   FLAG\_AS\_POTENTIALLY\_INCOMPLETE

&nbsp;   QUEUE\_FOR\_REPROCESSING

&nbsp;   MAX\_RETRIES = 3

END IF
