\## 🧠 \*\*PYTHON ARCHITECTURE - PROFESSIONAL PATTERNS\*\*



\### \*\*📋 Class-Based Design Approach:\*\*



```python

\\\\\\\\# This is like creating a "blueprint" for an object

class ContentAnalyzer:

\\\\\\\&nbsp;   def \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_init\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_(self):           # Constructor - sets up the object

\\\\\\\&nbsp;       self.procedures = \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[]      # Storage for found procedures

\\\\\\\&nbsp;       self.quality\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_threshold = 3.0  # Minimum coherence rating

\\\\\\\&nbsp;       

\\\\\\\&nbsp;   def find\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_procedures(self, text):     # Method - what it can do

\\\\\\\&nbsp;       """Identifies step-by-step instructions in text"""

\\\\\\\&nbsp;       procedures = \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[]

\\\\\\\&nbsp;       # Logic to identify coherent instruction sequences

\\\\\\\&nbsp;       return procedures

\\\\\\\&nbsp;       

\\\\\\\&nbsp;   def rank\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_coherence(self, procedures): # Quality assessment method

\\\\\\\&nbsp;       """Rates procedures 1-5 stars for clarity and completeness"""

\\\\\\\&nbsp;       ranked\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_procedures = \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[]

\\\\\\\&nbsp;       # Logic to evaluate instruction quality

\\\\\\\&nbsp;       return ranked\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_procedures

```



\### \*\*🎯 Why Classes Matter:\*\*

\- \*\*🗂️ Organization\*\* - Related functions grouped together

\- \*\*🔄 Reusability\*\* - Create multiple analyzer objects if needed

\- \*\*🔧 Maintainability\*\* - Easy to update one piece without breaking others

\- \*\*👔 Professional\*\* - Industry standard approach

\## 📺 \*\*CHAPTER MARKER SYSTEM - YOUR BREAKTHROUGH IDEA\*\*



\### \*\*🎯 The Vision: "Podcast-Style Chapter Markers"\*\*



\*\*Input:\*\* TXT file with timestamp data

```

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[00:03:45] Setting up your first campaign requires three key steps...

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[00:07:22] Now let's move on to keyword research methodology...

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[00:12:16] Budget allocation strategies are critical for ROI...

```



\*\*Processing:\*\*

```python

class ChapterGenerator:

\\\\\\\&nbsp;   def create\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_chapters(self, txt\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_file):

\\\\\\\&nbsp;       topics = self.identify\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_coherent\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_topics(segments)  

\\\\\\\&nbsp;       chapters = self.format\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_as\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_chapters(topics)

\\\\\\\&nbsp;       return chapters

\## 🔧 \*\*PROFESSIONAL PYTHON PATTERNS WE'LL USE\*\*



\### \*\*⚙️ 1. Configuration Management\*\*

```python

\\\\\\\\# config.py - All settings in one place

class Config:

\\\\\\\&nbsp;   INPUT\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_FOLDER = "data/txt\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_files/"

\\\\\\\&nbsp;   OUTPUT\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_FOLDER = "output/"  

\\\\\\\&nbsp;   COHERENCE\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_THRESHOLD = 3.0  # Minimum quality rating

\\\\\\\&nbsp;   CHAPTER\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_MIN\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_DURATION = 120  # 2 minutes minimum per chapter

\\\\\\\&nbsp;   GOOGLE\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_DRIVE\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_FOLDER = "INDEX\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_Output"

\\\\\\\&nbsp;   HTML\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_TEMPLATE = "templates/student\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_interface.html"

```



\### \*\*🛡️ 2. Error Handling\*\*

```python

def process\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_txt\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_file(self, filename):

\\\\\\\&nbsp;   try:

\\\\\\\&nbsp;       content = self.read\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_txt\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_file(filename)

\\\\\\\&nbsp;       procedures = self.analyze\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_content(content)

\\\\\\\&nbsp;       return procedures

\\\\\\\&nbsp;   except FileNotFoundError:

\\\\\\\&nbsp;       logging.error(f"File not found: {filename}")

\\\\\\\&nbsp;       return None

\\\\\\\&nbsp;   except Exception as e:

\\\\\\\&nbsp;       logging.error(f"Processing error in {filename}: {str(e)}")

\\\\\\\&nbsp;       return None

```



\### \*\*📝 3. Logging for Debugging\*\*

```python

import logging



\\\\\\\\# Set up professional logging

logging.basicConfig(

\\\\\\\&nbsp;   level=logging.INFO,

\\\\\\\&nbsp;   format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'

)



\\\\\\\\# Use throughout code

logging.info(f"Processing file: {filename}")

logging.debug(f"Found {len(procedures)} procedures")

logging.warning(f"Low coherence score: {score}")

```
